Step 1: Add the User
It’s just one simple command to add a user. In this case, we’re adding a user called mynewuser :

adduser mynewuser

Now set the password for the new user:

passwd mynewuser

Step 2: Grant Root Privileges to the User
For a refresher on editing files with vim see: New User Tutorial: Overview of the Vim Text Editor

visudo

Find the following code:

## Allow root to run any commands anywhere
root ALL=(ALL) ALL

In this case, we’re granting root privileges to the user mynewuser . Add the following below that code:

mynewuser ALL=(ALL) ALL

Then exit and save the file with the command :wq .
